# How to fix the wheels to the motor mounts and motors?

## Step 1: Grab one of the inflated wheels, place it like this:

## Step 2: Add the plastic circular connector to the centre, make sure it aligns with the holes in the centre:

## Step 3: Flip it over and add the large screws in the 4 holes

## Step 5: Flip it over it will look something like this. You must hold on to the screws at this point or they'll fall out.

## Step 6: Add the metal connector clamp to this. Most of them have a fixed pair they clamp well with in the lab.
